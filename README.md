This is a class assessment project. Here multiple linear regression has been performed using a given dataset name mlr6.csv. The goal of the analysis is to show the relationship between predictor variables (x1, x2, x3_num) and the target variables y. and evaluate the predictive performance of the model.  Time series also has also been performed here to show forecasting performance and model efficiency om given dataset. But that dataset needed to be renamed columns. Such as unnamed to Time and x to Value.  For both Data preparation, model evaluation, visualization, forecasting has been performed to check model effectiveness.
